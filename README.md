# CODENAMES Board Game Server and Frontend

This is a simple implementation of the famous board game - Codenames (by Vlaada Chv√°til) -
using __Node.js__, __Angular__ and __Google Material UI__. No any database is used, all the games are kept in runtime memory and removed in one hour of inactivity. 

The Game is implemented with Russian interface and includes Russian words dictionary (so far).
You can create your own dictionary by implementing `DictionaryModel` interface (see `GamesService` for usage) or simply
put extra yaml files in `dist/data` directory respecting the same structure as in others.
